# seff-array

An extension of the Slurm command 'seff' designed to handle job arrays and display information in a histogram.             
seff-array generates two histograms; one for the maximum memory usage of each job in the array, and one for the runtime of each job.

To use seff-array on the job array with ID `12345678`, simply run `seff-array 12345678`.
